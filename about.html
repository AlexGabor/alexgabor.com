<p>
  I'm a passionate Android developer focused on building great user experiences
  with code. Working at <a href="https://halcyonmobile.com/">HalcyonMobile</a>,
  I contributed to growing the team's knowledge on Architecture, Jetpack
  Compose, Kotlin Coroutines.

<p>
  I spent my formative years as an Android developer modernizing a
  <a

    >social network app for Lego</a
  >
  where 1 million kids shared safely their creations.

<p>
  I get easily motivated when it comes to implementing beautiful designs and I'm
  open to learning new technologies.

<p>
  Interested not only in making pretty apps, in my spare time I'm experimenting
  with <a href="https://instagram.com/alexandru_gabor/">creating images</a>.
